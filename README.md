## End Note - A Thank You to the Reader 

Thank you for taking the time to check out my portfolio and README! I hope that it will be a living project that grows along with me. So if you ever grow curious (or simply bored), feel free to bookmark the webpage and check it out to see what I've been up to! Or don't, the choice is yours friend! Regardless, please enjoy the fun fact and my second favorite gif below (maybe even share them with a friend!). 

**Fun Fact**: Johnny Appleseed's fruits weren't for eating. The apples that John Chapman planted were actually significantly more bitter than the apples you'd find in a groccery store today. "Johnny Appleseed" didn't want you to eat the apples his trees grew. Instead, he wanted you to use them to make hard apple cider. Truly, a worthy goal.
